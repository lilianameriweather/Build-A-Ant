Thank you for playing Build-A-Ant.  The object of the game is to Build-A-Ant by rolling the die.

Each side of the die represents a different part of the ant:

          1: Body
          2: Head
          3: Legs
          4: Antenna
          5: Eyes
          6: Abdomen

1   The player who goes first will roll the die. To draw a body part (either head or body),
        they must roll a 1 or 2. If they roll a 3 or higher, they will not draw anything as
        they do not have a head or body yet. Their turn will end immediately.
2   Player two will then roll the die and must get a one or a two to draw the head or the body.
3   Once the head and body are drawn, players can draw the eyes (5) and antennae (4) legs (3) and tail (6).
4   Players take turns rolling the die until one of them has successfully drawn all the parts to complete
        their ant. The ant consists of one body, one head, two eyes, two antennae, six legs, and one abdomen.
5   The first player to complete their ant wins the game.
6   In the case of a tie, where both players complete their ant in the same turn, the game is a draw.
7   Have fun playing the Build-A-Ant Drawing Game!
